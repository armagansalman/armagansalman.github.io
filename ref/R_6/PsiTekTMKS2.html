                        <p class="BodyText">Some men seem to attract success, power, wealth, attainment, with very little conscious effort; others conquer with great
                           difficulty; still others fail altogether to reach their ambitions, desires and ideals. Why is this so? Why should some men
                           realize their ambitions easily, others with difficulty, and still others not at all? The cause cannot be physical, else the
                           most perfect men, physically, would be the most successful. The difference, therefore, must be mental - must be in the mind;
                           hence mind must be the creative force, must constitute the sole difference between men. It is mind, therefore, which overcomes
                           environment and every other obstacle in the path of men. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">When the creative power of thought is fully understood, its effect will be seen to be marvelous. But such results cannot be
                           secured without proper application, diligence, and concentration. The student will find that the laws governing in the mental
                           and spiritual world are as fixed and infallible as in the material world. To secure the desired results, then, it is necessary
                           to know the law and to comply with it. A proper compliance with the law will be found to produce the desired result with invariable
                           exactitude. The student who learns that power comes from within, that he is weak only because he has depended on help from
                           outside, and who unhesitatingly throws himself on his own thought, instantly rights himself, stands erect, assumes a dominant
                           attitude, and works miracles.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">It is evident, therefore, that he who fails to fully investigate and take advantage of the wonderful progress which is being
                           made in this last and greatest science, will soon be as far behind as the man who would refuse to acknowledge and accept the
                           benefits which have accrued to mankind through an understanding of the laws of electricity.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">Of course, mind creates negative conditions just as readily as favorable conditions, and when we consciously or unconsciously
                           visualize every kind of lack, limitation and discord, we create these conditions; this is what many are unconsciously doing
                           all the time.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">This law as well as every other law is no respecter of persons, but is in constant operation and is relentlessly bringing
                           to each individual exactly what he has created; in other words, "Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap."
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">Abundance, therefore, depends upon a recognition of the laws of Abundance, and the fact that Mind is not only the creator,
                           but the only creator of all there is. Certainly nothing can be created, before we know that it can be created and then make
                           the proper effort. There is no more Electricity in the world today than there was fifty years ago, but until someone recognized
                           the law by which it could be made of service, we received no benefit; now that the law is understood, practically the whole
                           world is lit by it. So with the law of Abundance; it is only those who recognize the law and place themselves in harmony with
                           it, who share in its benefits.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">The scientific spirit now dominates every field of effort, relations of cause and effect are no longer ignored.</p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">The discovery of a region of law marked an epoch in human progress. It eliminated the element of uncertainty and caprice in
                           men's lives, and substituted law, reason and certitude.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">Men now understand that for every result there is an adequate and definite cause, so that when a given result is desired,
                           they seek the condition by which alone this result may be attained. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">The basis upon which all law rests was discovered by inductive reasoning which consists of comparing a number of separate
                           instances with one another until the common factor which gives rise to them all is seen.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">It is this method of study to which the civilized nations owe the greater part of their prosperity and the more valuable part
                           of their knowledge; it has lengthened life, it has mitigated pain, it has spanned rivers, it has brightened the night with
                           the splendor of day, extended the range of vision, accelerated motion, annihilated distance, facilitated intercourse, and
                           enabled men to descend into the sea, and into the air. What wonder then that men soon endeavored to extend the blessings of
                           this system of study to their method of thinking, so that when it became plainly evident that certain results followed a particular
                           method of thinking it only remained to classify these results.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">This method is scientific, and it is the only method by which we shall be permitted to retain that degree of liberty and freedom
                           which we have been accustomed to look upon as an inalienable right, because a people is safe at home and in the world only
                           if national preparedness mean such things as growing surplus of health, accumulated efficiency in public and private business
                           of whatever sort, continuous advance in the science and art of acting together, and the increasingly dominant endeavor to
                           make all of these and all other aspects of national development center and revolve about ascending life, single and collective,
                           for which science, art and ethics furnish guidance and controlling motives.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">The Master Key is based on absolute scientific truth and will unfold the possibilities that lie dormant in the individual,
                           and teach how they may be brought into powerful action, to increase the person's effective capacity, bringing added energy,
                           discernment, vigor and mental elasticity. The student who gains an understanding of the mental laws which are unfolded will
                           come into the possession of an ability to secure results hitherto undreamed of, and which has rewards hardly to be expressed
                           in words.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">It explains the correct use of both the receptive and active elements of the mental nature, and instructs the student in the
                           recognition of opportunity; it strengthens the will and reasoning powers, and teaches the cultivation and best uses of imagination,
                           desire, the emotions and the intuitional faculty. It gives initiative, tenacity of purpose, wisdom of choice, intelligent
                           sympathy and a thorough enjoyment of life on its higher planes.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">The Master Key teaches the use of Mind Power, true Mind Power, not any of the substitutes and perversions; it has nothing
                           to do with Hypnotism, Magic or any of the more or less fascinating deceptions by which many are led to think that something
                           can be had for nothing.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">The Master Key cultivates and develops the understanding which will enable you to control the body and thereby the health.
                           It improves and strengthens the Memory. It develops Insight, the kind of Insight which is so rare, the kind which is the distinguishing
                           characteristic of every successful business man, the kind which enables men to see the possibilities as well as the difficulties
                           in every situation, the kind which enables men to discern opportunity close at hand, for thousands fail to see opportunities
                           almost within their grasp while they are industriously working with situations which under no possibility can be made to realize
                           any substantial return.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">The Master Key develops Mental Power which means that others instinctively recognize that you are a person of force, of character
                           - that they want to do what you want them to do; it means that you attract men and things to you; that you are what some people
                           call "lucky", that "things come your way" that you have come into an understanding of the fundamental laws of Nature, and
                           have put yourself in harmony with them; that you are in tune with Infinite; that you understand the law of attraction, the
                           Natural laws of growth, and the Psychological laws on which all advantages in the social and business world rest.
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">Mental Power is creative power, it gives you the ability to create for yourself; it does not mean the ability to take something
                           away from someone else. Nature never does things that way. Nature makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before, and

                           the coarse to the fine, from the low potentiality to high potentiality. When we reach the invisible we find energy in its

                           had no meaning for him. The thoughts of success with which he has been impregnated are radiated to those around him, and they
                           in turn help him onward and upward; he attracts to him new and successful associates, and this in turn changes his environment;
                           so that by this simple exercise of thought, a man changes not only himself, but his environment, circumstances and conditions.
