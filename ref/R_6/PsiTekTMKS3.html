                        <p class="BodyText">1. That much gathers more is true on every plane of existence and that loss leads to greater loss is equally true. </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">2. Mind is creative, and conditions, environment and all experiences in life are the result of our habitual or predominant
                           mental attitude. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">3. The attitude of mind necessarily depends upon what we think. Therefore, the secret of all power, all achievement and all
                           possession depends upon our method of thinking. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">4. This is true because we must "be" before we can "do," and we can "do" only to the extent which we "are," and what we "are"
                           depends upon what we "think." 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">5. We cannot express powers that we do not possess. The only way by which we may secure possession of power is to become conscious
                           of power, and we can never become conscious of power until we learn that all power is from within. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">6. There is a world within â€“ a world of thought and feeling and power; of light and life and beauty and, although invisible,
                           its forces are mighty. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">7. The world within is governed by mind. When we discover this world we shall find the solution for every problem, the cause
                           for every effect; and since the world within is subject to our control, all laws of power and possession are also within our
                           control. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">8. The world without is a reflection of the world within. What appears without is what has been found within. In the world
                           within may be found infinite Wisdom, infinite Power, infinite Supply of all that is necessary, waiting for unfoldment, development
                           and expression. If we recognize these potentialities in the world within they will take form in the world without. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">9. Harmony in the world within will be reflected in the world without by harmonious conditions, agreeable surroundings, the
                           best of everything. It is the foundation of health and a necessary essential to all greatness, all power, all attainment,
                           all achievement and all success.

                        <p class="BodyText">10. Harmony in the world within means the ability to control our thoughts, and to determine for ourselves how any experience
                           is to affect us. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">11. Harmony in the world within results in optimism and affluence; affluence within results in affluence without. </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">12. The world without reflects the circumstances and the conditions of the consciousness within. </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">13. If we find wisdom in the world within, we shall have the understanding to discern the marvelous possibilities that are
                           latent in this world within, and we shall be given the power to make these possibilities manifest in the world without. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">14. As we become conscious of the wisdom in the world within, we mentally take possession of this wisdom, and by taking mental
                           possession we come into actual possession of the power and wisdom necessary to bring into manifestation the essentials necessary
                           for our most complete and harmonious development. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">15. The world within is the practical world in which the men and women of power generate courage, hope, enthusiasm, confidence,
                           trust and faith, by which they are given the fine intelligence to see the vision and the practical skill to make the vision
                           real. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">16. Life is an unfoldment, not accretion. What comes to us in the world without is what we already possess in the world within.
                           
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">17. All possession is based on consciousness. All gain is the result of an accumulative consciousness. All loss is the result
                           of a scattering consciousness. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">18. Mental efficiency is contingent upon harmony; discord means confusion; therefore, he who would acquire power must be in
                           harmony with Natural Law. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">19. We are related to the world without by the objective mind. The brain is the organ of this mind and the cerebro-spinal
                           system of nerves puts us in conscious communication with every part of the body. This system of nerves responds to every sensation
                           of light, heat, odor, sound and taste. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">20. When this mind thinks correctly, when it understands the truth, when the thoughts sent through the cerebro-spinal nervous
                           system to the body are constructive, these sensations are pleasant, harmonious. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">21. The result is that we build strength, vitality and all constructive forces into our body, but it is through this same
                           objective mind that all distress, sickness, lack, limitation and every form of discord and inharmony is admitted to our lives.
                           It is therefore through the objective mind, by wrong thinking, that we are related to all destructive forces. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">22. We are related to the world within by the subconscious mind. The solar plexus is the organ of this mind; the sympathetic
                           system of nerves presides over all subjective sensations, such as joy, fear, love, emotion, respiration, imagination and all
                           other subconscious phenomena. It is through the subconscious that we are connected with the Universal Mind and brought into
                           relation with the Infinite constructive forces of the Universe.

                        <p class="BodyText">23. It is the coordination of these two centers of our being, and the understanding of their functions, which is the great
                           secret of life. With this knowledge we can bring the objective and subjective minds into conscious cooperation and thus coordinate
                           the finite and the infinite. Our future is entirely within our own control. It is not at the mercy of any capricious or uncertain
                           external power.

                        <p class="BodyText">24. All agree that there is but one Principle or Consciousness pervading the entire Universe, occupying all space, and being
                           essentially the same in kind at every point of its presence. It is all powerful, all wisdom and always present. All thoughts
                           and things are within Itself. It is all in all. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">25. There is but one consciousness in the universe able to think; and when it thinks, its thoughts become objective things
                           to it. As this Consciousness is omnipresent, it must be present within every individual; each individual must be a manifestation
                           of that Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Consciousness. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">26. As there is only one Consciousness in the Universe that is able to think it necessarily follows that your consciousness
                           is identical with the Universal Consciousness, or, in other words, all mind is one mind. There is no dodging this conclusion.

                        <p class="BodyText">27. The consciousness that focuses in your brain cells is the same consciousness which focuses in the brain cells of every
                           other individual. Each individual is but the individualization of the Universal, the Cosmic Mind.

                        <p class="BodyText">28. The Universal Mind is static or potential energy; it simply is; it can manifest only through the individual, and the individual
                           can manifest only through the Universal. They are one. 
                        </p>
                        		
                        <p class="BodyText">29. The ability of the individual to think is his ability to act on the Universal and bring it into manifestation. Human consciousness
                           consists only in the ability of man to think. Mind in itself is believed to be a subtle form of static energy, from which
                           arises the activities called â€˜thought,â€™ which is the dynamic phase of mind. Mind is static energy, thought is dynamic energy
                           - the two phases of the same thing. Thought is therefore the vibratory force formed by converting static mind into dynamic
                           mind.

                        <p class="BodyText">30. As the sum of all attributes are contained in the Universal Mind, which is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, these
                           attributes must be present at all times in their potential form in every individual. Therefore, when the individual thinks,
                           the thought is compelled by its nature to embody itself in an objectivity or condition which will correspond with its origin.

                           you can apply it to any condition; in other words, you will have come into conscious cooperation with Omnipotent law which
                           is the fundamental basis of all things.

                        <p class="BodyText">34. The Universal Mind is the life principle of every atom which is in existence; every atom is continually striving to manifest

                        <p class="BodyText">35. A majority of mankind lives in the world without; few have found the world within, and yet it is the world within that
                           makes the world without; it is therefore creative and everything which you find in your world without has been created by
                           you in the world within.

                           world without and the world within. The world within is the cause, the world without the effect; to change the effect you
                           must change the cause.

                        <p class="BodyText">37. You will at once see that this is a radically new and different idea; most men try to change effects by working with effects.
                           They fail to see that this is simply changing one form of distress for another. To remove discord, we must remove the cause,
                           and this cause can be found only in the world within.

                           and so is one with every other individual.

                        <p class="BodyText">40. Recognition is a mental process, mental action is therefore the interaction of the individual upon the Universal Mind,
                           and as the Universal Mind is the intelligence which pervades all space and animates all living things, this mental action
                           and reaction is the law of causation, but the principle of causation does not obtain in the individual but in the Universal
                           Mind. It is not an objective faculty but a subjective process, and the results are seen in an infinite variety of conditions
                           and experiences.

                           highest degree. It takes form according to the mental demand. Thought forms the mold or matrix from which the substance expresses.

                           be no greater blessing than these from a material and social standpoint.

                           let your thoughts roam where they will but be perfectly still for from fifteen minutes to half an hour; continue this for
                           three or four days or for a week until you secure full control of your physical being.
