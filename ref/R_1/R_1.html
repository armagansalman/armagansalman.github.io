    I looked around upon the world, and saw that it was shadowed by sorrow and 
    scorched by the fierce fires of suffering. And I looked for the cause. I 
    looked around, but could not find it; I looked in books, but could not find 
    it; I looked within, and found there both the cause and the self-made nature 
    of that cause. I looked again, and deeper, and found the remedy.
    </p>

    <p id="ch.0:p.2">
    I found one Law, the Law of Love; one Life, the Life of adjustment to that 
    Law; one Truth, the truth of a conquered mind and a quiet and obedient heart. 
    And I dreamed of writing a book which should help men and women, whether rich 
    or poor, learned or unlearned, worldly or unworldly, to find within themselves 
    the source of all success, all happiness, all accomplishment, all truth. And 
    the dream remained with me, and at last became substantial; and now I send it
     forth into the world on its mission of healing and blessedness, knowing that
      it cannot fail to reach the homes and hearts of those who are waiting and
       ready to receive it.

        <p id="ch.1.1:p.1">
        Unrest and pain and sorrow are the shadows of life. There is no heart
         in all the world that has not felt the sting of pain, no mind has not
          been tossed upon the dark waters of trouble, no eye that has not wept
           the hot blinding tears of unspeakable anguish.
        </p>
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.2">
        There is no household where the Great Destroyers, disease and death, 
        have not entered, severing heart from heart, and casting over all the 
        dark pall of sorrow. In the strong, and apparently indestructible meshes
         of evil all are more or less fast caught, and pain, unhappiness, and 
         misfortune wait upon mankind. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.3">
        With the object of escaping, or in some way mitigating this overshadowing gloom, men and women rush blindly into innumerable devices, pathways by which they fondly hope to enter into a happiness which will not pass away.

        Spiritual meditation is the pathway to Divinity. It is the mystic

        world, and sets his face resolutely toward the Father’s Home, must plant 
        his feet upon its golden rounds. Without its aid you cannot grow into the
