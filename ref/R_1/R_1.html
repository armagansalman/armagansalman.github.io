    Dünya'ya bakındım, ve üzüntü ile gölgelenmiş ve ızdırabın azılı ateşi 
    ile kavrulmuş olduğunu gördüm. Ve sebebini aradım. Etrafa bakındım, ama bulamadım;
    kitaplara baktım, ama bulamadım; içime baktım, ve orada sebebini ve sebebin 
    doğasının kişinin kendisi olduğunu gördüm. Tekrar baktım, ve daha derine, ve 
    çareyi buldum.

    Bir Kanun buldum, Sevginin Kanunu; bir Yaşam, o Kanuna uymanın Yaşamı; bir 
    Gerçek, zapt edilmiş bir zihnin ve sessiz ve itaatkar bir yüreğin gerçeği. Ve
    erkek ve kadınlara, zengin ya da fakir, eğitimli ya da eğitimsiz, dünyevi ya 
    da ruhani fark etmeksizin, kendi içlerinde tüm başarıyı, tüm mutluluğu, tüm 
    kazanımları, tüm gerçeği bulmalarına yardım edecek bir kitabın hayalini kurdum.
    Ve bu hayal benimle kaldı, sonunda azımsanmayacak hale geldi; ve şimdi onu görevi
    iyileştirme ve kutsanmışlık olacak şekilde dünyaya gönderiyorum, biliyorum ki
    bekleyenlerin ve almaya hazır olanların yuvalarına ve yüreklerine ulaşmama imkanı

        Rahatsızlık ve acı ve üzüntü yaşamın gölgeleridir. Dünya üzerinde acının
        iğnesini hissetmeyen yürek yoktur, derdin karanlık sularına atılmamış 
        zihin yoktur, söylenemeyecek derecede ızdırabın sıcak, kör edici gözyaşlarını

            !DEVAM!
        
        There is no household where the Great Destroyers, disease and death, 
        have not entered, severing heart from heart, and casting over all the 
        dark pall of sorrow. In the strong, and apparently indestructible meshes
         of evil all are more or less fast caught, and pain, unhappiness, and 
         misfortune wait upon mankind. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.3">
        With the object of escaping, or in some way mitigating this overshadowing 
        gloom, men and women rush blindly into innumerable devices, pathways by 
        which they fondly hope to enter into a happiness which will not pass away. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.4">
        Such are the drunkard and the harlot, who revel in sensual excitements; 
        such is the exclusive aesthete, who shuts himself out from the sorrows of 
        the world, and surrounds himself with enervating luxuries; such is he who 
        thirsts for wealth or fame, and subordinates all things to the achievement 
        of that object; and such are they who seek consolation in the performance 
        of religious rites.
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.5">
        And to all the happiness sought seems to come, and the soul, for a time, 
        is lulled into a sweet security, and an intoxicating forgetfulness of the 
        existence of evil; but the day of disease comes at last, or some great sorrow, 
        temptation, or misfortune breaks suddenly in on the unfortified soul, and 
        the fabric of its fancied happiness is torn to shreds. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.6">
        So over the head of every personal joy hangs the Damocletian sword of pain, 
        ready, at any moment, to fall and crush the soul of him who is unprotected 
        by knowledge. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.7">
        The child cries to be a man or woman; the man and woman sigh for the lost 
        felicity of childhood. The poor man chafes under the chains of poverty by 
        which he is bound, and the rich man often lives in fear of poverty, or 
        scours the world in search of an elusive shadow he calls happiness. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.8">
        Sometimes the soul feels that it has found a secure peace and happiness 
        in adopting a certain religion, in embracing an intellectual philosophy, 
        or in building up an intellectual or artistic ideal; but some overpowering 
        temptation proves the religion to be inadequate or insufficient; the theoretical 
        philosophy is found to be a useless prop; or in a moment, the idealistic 
        statue upon which the devotee has for years been laboring, is shattered 
        into fragments at his feet. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.9">
        Is there, then, no way of escape from pain and sorrow? Are there no means 
        by which bonds of evil may be broken? Is permanent happiness, secure 
        prosperity, and abiding peace a foolish dream? 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.10">
        No, there is a way, and I speak it with gladness, by which evil can be 
        slain for ever; there is a process by which disease, poverty, or any 
        adverse condition or circumstance can be put on one side never to return; 
        there is a method by which a permanent prosperity can be secured, free 
        from all fear of the return of adversity, and there is a practice by which 
        unbroken and unending peace and bliss can be partaken of and realized. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.11">
        And the beginning of the way which leads to this glorious realization is 
        the acquirement of a right understanding of the nature of evil. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.12">
        It is not sufficient to deny or ignore evil; it must be understood. It is 
        not enough to pray to God to remove the evil; you must find out why it is 
        there, and what lesson it has for you. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.13">
        It is of no avail to fret and fume and chafe at the chains which bind you; 
        you must know why and how you are bound. Therefore, reader, you must get 
        outside yourself, and must begin to examine and understand yourself. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.14">
        You must cease to be a disobedient child in the school of experience and 
        must begin to learn, with humility and patience, the lessons that are set 
        for your edification and ultimate perfection; for evil, when rightly 
        understood, is found to be, not an unlimited power or principle in the 
        universe, but a passing phase of human experience, and it therefore becomes 
        a teacher to those who are willing to learn. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.15">
        Evil is not an abstract some thing outside yourself; it is an experience 
        in your own heart, and by patiently examining and rectifying your heart 
        you will be gradually led into the discovery of the origin and nature of 
        evil, which will necessarily be followed by its complete eradication. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.16">
        All evil is corrective and remedial, and is therefore not permanent. It 
        is rooted in ignorance, ignorance of the true nature and relation of 
        things, and so long as we remain in that state of ignorance, we remain 
        subject to evil. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.17">
        There is no evil in the universe which is not the result of ignorance, 
        and which would not, if we were ready and willing to learn its lesson, 
        lead us to higher wisdom, and then vanish away. But men remain in evil, 
        and it does not pass away because men are not willing or prepared to learn 
        the lesson which it came to teach them. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.18">
        I knew a child who, every night when its mother took it to bed, cried to 
        be allowed to play with the candle; and one night, when the mother was off 
        guard for a moment, the child took hold of the candle; the inevitable 
        result followed, and the child never wished to play with the candle again. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.19">
        By its one foolish act it learned, and learned perfectly the lesson of 
        obedience, and entered into the knowledge that fire burns. And, this 
        incident is a complete illustration of the nature, meaning, and ultimate 
        result of all sin and evil. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.20">
        As the child suffered through its own ignorance of the real nature of fire, 
        so older children suffer through their ignorance of the real nature of the 
        things which they weep for and strive after, and which harm them when they 
        are secured; the only difference being that in the latter case the ignorance 
        and evil are more deeply rooted and obscure. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.21">
        Evil has always been symbolized by darkness, and Good by light, and hidden 
        within the symbol is contained the perfect interpretation, the reality; 
        for, just as light always floods the universe, and darkness is only a mere 
        speck or shadow cast by a small body intercepting a few rays of the 
        illimitable light, so the Light of the Supreme Good is the positive and 
        life-giving power which floods the universe, and evil the insignificant 
        shadow cast by the self that intercepts and shuts off the illuminating 
        rays which strive for entrance. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.22">
        When night folds the world in its black impenetrable mantle, no matter 
        how dense the darkness, it covers but the small space of half our little 
        planet, while the whole universe is ablaze with living light, and every 
        soul knows that it will awake in the light in the morning. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.23">
        Know, then, that when the dark night of sorrow, pain, or misfortune settles 
        down upon your soul, and you stumble along with weary and uncertain steps, 
        that you are merely intercepting your own personal desires between yourself 
        and the boundless light of joy and bliss, and the dark shadow that covers 
        you is cast by none and nothing but yourself. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.24">
        And just as the darkness without is but a negative shadow, an unreality 
        which comes from nowhere, goes to nowhere, and has no abiding dwelling 
        place, so the darkness within is equally a negative shadow passing over 
        the evolving and Lightborn soul.
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.25">
        “But,” I fancy I hear someone say, “why pass through the darkness of evil 
        at all?” Because, by ignorance, you have chosen to do so, and because, by 
        doing so, you may understand both good and evil, and may the more appreciate 
        the light by having passed through the darkness. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.26">
        As evil is the direct outcome of ignorance, so, when the lessons of evil 
        are fully learned, ignorance passes away, and wisdom takes its place. But 
        as a disobedient child refuses to learn its lessons at school, so it is 
        possible to refuse to learn the lessons of experience, and thus to remain 
        in continual darkness, and to suffer continually recurring punishments in 
        the form of disease, disappointment, and sorrow. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.27">
        He, therefore, who would shake himself free of the evil which encompasses 
        him, must be willing and ready to learn, and must be prepared to undergo 
        that disciplinary process without which no grain of wisdom or abiding 
        happiness and peace can be secured. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.28">
        A man may shut himself up in a dark room, and deny that the light exists, 
        but it is everywhere without, and darkness exists only in his own little 
        room. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.29">
        So you may shut out the light of Truth, or you may begin to pull down 
        the walls of prejudice, self-seeking and error which you have built around 
        yourself, and so let in the glorious and omnipresent Light. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.30">
        By earnest self-examination strive to realize, and not merely hold as a 
        theory, that evil is a passing phase, a self-created shadow; that all your 
        pains, sorrows and misfortunes have come to you by a process of undeviating 
        and absolutely perfect law; have come to you because you deserve and require 
        them, and that by first enduring, and then understanding them, you may be 
        made stronger, wiser, nobler. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="ch.1.1:p.31">
        When you have fully entered into this realization, you will be in a 
        position to mould your own circumstances, to transmute all evil into 
        good and to weave, with a master hand, the fabric of your destiny. 
        </p>

        Having seen and realized that evil is but a passing shadow thrown, by the 
        intercepting self, across the transcendent Form of the Eternal Good, and 
        that the world is a mirror in which each sees a reflection of himself, we 
        now ascend, by firm and easy steps, to that plane of perception whereon is 
        seen and realized the Vision of the Law.

        machinations of the scheming witch, the cruel giant, or the wicked king.

        happiness, is not an outward possession, but an inward realization.

        Spiritual meditation is the pathway to Divinity. It is the mystic 
        ladder which reaches from earth to heaven, from error to Truth, from pain 
        to peace. Every saint has climbed it; every sinner must sooner or later 
        come to it, and every weary pilgrim that turns his back upon self and the 
        world, and sets his face resolutely toward the Father’s Home, must plant 
        his feet upon its golden rounds. Without its aid you cannot grow into the 
        divine state, the divine likeness, the divine peace, and the fadeless 
        glories and unpolluting joys of Truth will remain hidden from you.

        Upon the battlefield of the human soul two masters are ever contending

        the master of self, called also the "Prince of this world," and the master 
        of Truth, called also the Father God. The master self is that rebellious 
        one whose weapons are passion, pride, avarice, vanity, self-will, 
        implements of darkness; the master Truth is that meek and lowly one whose 
        weapons are gentleness, patience, purity, sacrifice, humility, love,

        Faith and the chisel of Patience to bring it into manifestation. And that 
        Divine Image is revealed and realized as stainless, selfless Love.

        nature of his material existence, and in his sane and silent moments has tried
