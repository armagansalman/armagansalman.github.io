    Düşüncenin aracıdır, ve, istediğini şekillendirirerek,<br>
    Binlerce neşe, binlerce illet ortaya çıkarır:-<br>

    <p>BU küçük kitap (meditasyon ve deneyim sonucudur), üzerine fazlasıyla 
    yazılmış olan düşüncenin gücü konusunda kapsamlı bir inceleme değildir. 
    Açıklayıcı olmak yerine, fikir vericidir. Amacı, erkek ve kadınları şu 
    gerçeğin keşfine ve farkındalığına teşvik etmektir:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
       "Onlar, kendi kendilerini yapanlardır."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>bu, kendi seçtikleri ve destekledikleri düşüncelerin etkisiyledir; öyle 
    ki, zihin usta-dokuyucudur, hem içteki karakter giysisinin hem de dıştaki 
    durumların, ve öyle ki, insanlar şimdiye kadar bilgisizlik ve acı ile 
    dokumuş olsalar da artık aydınlanma ve mutluluk ile dokuyabilirler.</p>

        <h3 id="ch.1">1. Düşünce ve Karakter</h3>
    <p>
    
    <p id="ch.1:p.1">
    "Kişinin kalbinde düşündüğü neyse kendisi de odur," aforizması sadece bir
    insanın tümünü kapsamaz, aynı zamanda kendi yaşamının tüm koşullarını
    ve durumlarını kavrayacak kadar uzanır. Kişi kelimenin tam anlamıyla <i>ne 
    düşünüyorsa</i> odur, karakteri tüm düşüncelerinin toplamıdır.
    </p>

    <p>
    Bitkinin tohumdan çıktığı, ve onsuz olamayacağı gibi, kişinin her yaptığı da
    düşüncenin saklı tohumlarından ortaya çıkar, ve o tohumlar olmadan ortaya çıkmış 
    olamaz. Bu durum "ani" veya "hesaplanmamış" olduğu söylenen eylemler için de 
    aynı derecede geçerlidir.
    </p>

    <p>
    Eylem düşüncenin çiçeğidir, ve neşe ile eziyet onun meyveleridir; böylece
    insan kendi idaresinin tatlı veya acı meyvelerini toplar.
    </p>
    
        <blockquote>
          <p>
          Zihindeki düşünce olduğumuz kişiyi oluşturdu<br>
          Düşünce ile işlendi ve inşa edildi. Eğer kişinin zihni<br>
          Fena düşüncelere sahipse, acı ona gelir<br>
          Öküzün arkasından tekerleğin geldiği gibi....
          </p>
          <p>
          ..Eğer kişi sürdürürse<br>
          Saf düşüncede kalmayı, neşe onu takip eder<br>
          Kendi gölgesi gibi-şüphesiz."
          </p>
        </blockquote>

    <p>
    Yasa gereği insan bir büyümedir, ve hünerle yapılmış bir oluşum değildir,
    ve sebep sonuç yasası, gözüken ve materyel şeylerde olduğu gibi düşüncenin 
    gizli aleminde de kesin ve değişmezdir. Soylu ve Tanrısal bir karakter kayırma
    ya da şans sonucu değildir, doğru düşüncenin devamlı uğraşının doğal sonucudur,
    uzun süre el üstünde tutulan Tanrısal düşüncelerin ürünüdür. Kalitesiz ve kaba
    bir karakter, aynı şekilde, rezil düşüncelere sürekli sahip olunmanın sonucudur.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    İnsan kendini yapar veya bozar; kendi düşünce fabrikasında kendini yok ettiği
    silahları yapar; aynı zamanda kendi tasarladığı aletlerle kendisi için 
    neşe güç ve huzurdan cennetlik köşkler üretir. Düşüncenin doğru seçiimi ve
    doğru uygulanışıyla insan Kutsal Mükemmelliğe ulaşır; düşüncenin suistimali
    ve yanlış kullanımı ile, hayvandan düşük bir seviyeye iner. Bu iki ucun arasında
    karakterin tüm seviyeleri bulunur, ve kişi onların yapanı ve ustasıdır.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Günümüzde ruhla ilgili açığa çıkarılmış tüm güzel gerçeklerin arasında, hiçbiri
    bunun kadar sevindirici ve bereketli değildir-öyle ki kişi düşüncenin ustasıdır,
    karaktere şekil verendir, koşulları, çevreyi ve kaderi yapan ve onlara yön verendir.
    </p>

    <p>
    Güç, Akıl, ve Sevgiden bir varlık , ve kendi düşüncelerinin efendisi olarak,
    insan her duruma ait anahtarı taşır, ve kendini istediği şekilde yapan
    dönüştürücü ve yenileyici vasıtayı kendinde içerir.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    İnsan her zaman ustadır, en güçsüz ve en terk edilmiş halinde bile; ama bu
    güçsüz ve alçalmış halde o kendi "konağını" yanlış yöneten aptal bir ustadır.
    Kişi kendi koşullarına kafa yormaya başladığında, ve kendi varlığını oluşturan
    Yasa'yı özenle aradığında, o zaman enerjisini akıllı bir şekilde yönlendirerek,
    ve düşüncelerini yararlı konular üstüne biçimlendirerek, akıllı ustaya dönüşür, 
    Böyle olan kişi bilinçli ustadır, ve insan yalnızca kendi içindeki düşüncenin
    yasalarını keşfederek bu hale gelir; öyle ki bu keşif tamamen bir uygulama,
    kişisel analiz ve deneyim konusudur.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Yalnızca önemli ölçüde arama ve kazı sonrası altın ve elmaslar elde edilir, ve
    insan kendi varlığıyla ilgili tüm gerçeği bulabilir, eğer kendi ruh madeninin
    derinliklerine doğru kazarsa bu geçerlidir; ve kişi kendi karakterini yapandır,
    hayatına biçim verendir, kendi kaderini inşa edendir, bunu hatasızca kanıtlayabilir
    , eğer düşüncelerini izler, kontrol eder, ve değiştirirse, onların kendi üstündeki
    , başkalarındaki ve kendi hayatı ile durumları üstündeki etkilerini takip ederek, 
    sabırlı pratik ve incelemeyle sebep ile sonucu bağlayarak, ve her deneyimini
    kullanarak, en basit olan, günlük olayları dahil, Anlayış, Akıl, Güç olan kendinin
    bilgisini elde etmek için kullanır. Bu yönde, başka hiçbirinde olmadığı kadar,
    yasa öyle kesindir ki "Arayan kişi bulur; ve kapı çalan kişiye açılır;" çünkü
    sadece sabır, pratik, ve bitmeyen ısrar ile kişi Bilginin Tapınağının Kapısından
    girebilir.

        <h3 id="ch.2">2. Düşüncenin Durumlar Üzerine Etkisi</h3>
    <p id="ch.2:p.1">
    KİŞİ'nin zihni bir bahçeye benzetilebilir, bu bahçe akıllıca işlenmiş olabilir
    veya kontrolsüz büyümesine izin verilmiş olabilir; ancak işlenmiş ya da ilgilenmemiş
    olsa dahi, ürün vermesi zorunludur ve verecektir. Eğer hiç işe yarar tohumlar
    ekilmemişse, bu durumda bolca faydasız ot tohumları içine düşecektir, ve ilgili
    ürünleri üretecektir.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.2">
    Bir bahçıvanın arsasını işlemesi gibi, onu zararlı otlardan uzak tutması, ve
    ihtiyacı olan çiçekleri ve meyveleri büyütmesi gibi, kişi aynı şekilde kendi
    zihin bahçesiyle ilgilenebilir, yanlış olan, işe yaramaz, saf olmayan
    düşünceleri ayıklayarak, ve doğru, işe yarar, ve saf düşüncelerin 
    çiçekleri ve meyvelerini mükemmelliğe doğru yetiştirerek. Bu süreci izleyerek,
    kişi önünde sonunda kendi ruhunun usta-bahçıvanı olduğunu keşfeder, yaşamının
    idarecisi olduğunu. Kişi aynı zamanda, kendindeki düşüncenin yasalarını açığa
    çıkarır, ve artan kesinlikle düşünce-güçlerinin ve zihin elemanlarının kendi
    karakterinin, durumlarının ve kaderinin şekillenmesindeki çalışma şeklini anlar.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.3">
    Düşünce ve karakter birdir, ve karakterin yalnızca çevreden ve durumlardan ortaya
    çıkabileceği gibi, kişinin dışındaki durumların her zaman kendi iç hali ile harmoni
    içinde olduğu görülür. Bu, kişinin anlık olarak içinde bulunduğu durumun onun 
    karakterinin tamamını gösterdiği anlamına gelmez, ancak o durumlar kişinin kendi 
    bazı hayati zihin-elemanları ile yakından bağlıdır, öyle ki o anlığına, kendi 
    gelişimi için vazgeçilmezdir.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.4">
    Her insanın bulunduğu yer kendi varlığının yasasına göredir; kendi karakterine 
    inşa ettiği düşünceleri onu oraya götürmüştür, ve kendi hayatının düzeninde 
    şansa yer yoktur, her şey sadece asla hata yapmayan yasanın sonucudur. Bu, 
    çevresiyle "harmoni dışında" hissedenler kadar onunla memnun olanlar için de doğrudur.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.5">
    Gelişen ve evrime uğrayan bir varlık olarak, kişi gelişebileceğini öğrenebileceği 
    yerdedir; ve herhangi bir durumunda onun spiritüel gelişimi için bulunanı öğrendikçe, 
    o durum geçer ve yerini başka durumlara bırakır.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.6">
    Kişi kendini dış durumlardan oluştuğuna inandıkça harabeye döner, ama yaratıcı 
    bir güç olduğunun farkına vardığında, ve durumların büyüdüğü kendi gizli toprağına 
    ve tohumlarına hükmedebileceğini anladığında, hak ederek kendi kendinin ustası olur.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.7">
    Kendine hakimiyet ve kendini saflaştırma konusunda herhangi bir süre pratik 
    yapmış kişi durumların düşüncelerden ortaya çıktığını bilir, durumlarındaki 
    değişimin mental durumundaki değişim ile birebir orantılı olduğunu fark ettiği 
    için bu böyledir. Bu o kadar doğrudur ki insan karakterindeki kusurları düzeltmek 
    için ciddiyetle kendini verdiğinde, ve hızlı ve belirgin gelişim yaptığında, 
    hızla ardı ardına dönüşümlerden geçer.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.8">
    Ruh kendinde gizlice barındırdığını çeker; sevdiğini de, ve korktuğunu da; 
    el üstünde tuttuğu arzulara erişir; erdemli olmayan arzularının seviyesine düşer, 
    - ve durumlar da ruhun kendi kendini dönmesinin aracıdır.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.9">
    Zihne ekilen veya düşmesine izin verilmiş her düşünce-tohumu, ve orada kök salanlar, 
    kendinde olanı üretir, önünde sonunda davranış olarak çiçeklenir, ve fırsat ve 
    durum olan meyvesini verir. İyi düşünceler iyi meyve verir, kötülerse kötü meyve 
    verir.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.10">
    Dış dünyadaki durumlar düşüncenin iç dünyasının şeklini alır, ve bireyin nihai 
    iyiliği için, hoş ya da hoş olmayan dış durumlar etkenlerdir. Kendi hasadını biçen 
    kişi olarak insan acıyla ve neşe ile öğrenir.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.11">
    En derinindeki arzuları, büyük amaçları, düşünceleri takip edip de kendinin bunlarla 
    domine edilmesine izin vererek, (saf olmayan hayallerin takip ederek veya azimle 
    güçlü ve yüksek olan yolu yürüyerek), kişi sonunda onların meyvesine ve hayatının 
    dış durumlarının tamamlanmasına ulaşır.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.12">
    Kişi yaşlılar evine veya cezaevine kaderin veya durumların tiranlığı sayesinde gelmez,
    aşağı düşünceler ve dip arzuların yoluyla gelir. Ya da saf-zihinli biri herhangi dış etken 
    yüzünden aniden suça kaymaz; suçlu düşünce uzun zamandır kalpte gizlice büyütülmüştür, 
    ve fırsatı geldiğinde topladığı gücü açığa çıkarmıştır. Durumlar insanı belirlemez; 
    onu kendine belli eder. Kötülüğe inme ve onunla gelen acılar kötü niyetli eğilim dışında 
    hiçbir durumla olamaz, veya erdemli niyetlerin sürekli yetiştirilmesi olmadan 
    kişi erdeme yükselemez;  ve insan, böylece, düşüncenin lordu ve ustasıdır, kendini 
    yapandır ve çevresinin yazarıdır. Doğumda bile ruh kendine gelir ve dünyevi 
    kutsal yolculuğunda kendini ortaya çıkaran durumların kombinasyonlarını kendine çeker, 
    bunlar ki onun kendi saflığı, kirliliği, kendi gücü ve güçsüzlüğüdür.
    </p>

    !DEVAM!
    Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are. Their whims, 
    fancies, and ambitions are thwarted at every step, but their inmost thoughts 
    and desires are fed with their own food, be it foul or clean. The "divinity 
    that shapes our ends" is in ourselves; it is our very self. Only himself 
    manacles man: thought and action are the gaolers of Fate—they imprison, 
    being base; they are also the angels of Freedom—they liberate, being noble. 
    Not what he wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. 
    His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonize 
    with his thoughts and actions.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.14">
    In the light of this truth, what, then, is the meaning of "fighting against 
    circumstances?" It means that a man is continually revolting against an effect 
    without, while all the time he is nourishing and preserving its cause in his 
    heart. That cause may take the form of a conscious vice or an unconscious 
    weakness; but whatever it is, it stubbornly retards the efforts of its 
    possessor, and thus calls aloud for remedy.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.15">
    Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve 
    themselves; they therefore remain bound. The man who does not shrink from 
    self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the object upon which his heart 
    is set. This is as true of earthly as of heavenly things. Even the man whose 
    sole object is to acquire wealth must be prepared to make great personal 
    sacrifices before he can accomplish his object; and how much more so he who 
    would realize a strong and well-poised life?
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.16">
    Here is a man who is wretchedly poor. He is extremely anxious that his 
    surroundings and home comforts should be improved, yet all the time he shirks 
    his work, and considers he is justified in trying to deceive his employer on 
    the ground of the insufficiency of his wages. Such a man does not understand 
    the simplest rudiments of those principles which are the basis of true 
    prosperity, and is not only totally unfitted to rise out of his wretchedness, 
    but is actually attracting to himself a still deeper wretchedness by dwelling 
    in, and acting out, indolent, deceptive, and unmanly thoughts.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.17">
    Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful and persistent disease as 
    the result of gluttony. He is willing to give large sums of money to get rid 
    of it, but he will not sacrifice his gluttonous desires. He wants to gratify 
    his taste for rich and unnatural viands and have his health as well. Such a 
    man is totally unfit to have health, because he has not yet learned the first 
    principles of a healthy life.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.18">
    Here is an employer of labour who adopts crooked measures to avoid paying the 
    regulation wage, and, in the hope of making larger profits, reduces the wages 
    of his workpeople. Such a man is altogether unfitted for prosperity, and when 
    he finds himself bankrupt, both as regards reputation and riches, he blames 
    circumstances, not knowing that he is the sole author of his condition.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.19">
    I have introduced these three cases merely as illustrative of the truth that 
    man is the causer (though nearly always is unconsciously) of his circumstances, 
    and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is continually frustrating its 
    accomplishment by encouraging thoughts and desires which cannot possibly 
    harmonize with that end. Such cases could be multiplied and varied almost 
    indefinitely, but this is not necessary, as the reader can, if he so resolves, 
    trace the action of the laws of thought in his own mind and life, and until 
    this is done, mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of reasoning.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.20">
    Circumstances, however, are so complicated, thought is so deeply rooted, and 
    the conditions of happiness vary so, vastly with individuals, that a man’s 
    entire soul-condition (although it may be known to himself) cannot be judged 
    by another from the external aspect of his life alone. A man may be honest in 
    certain directions, yet suffer privations; a man may be dishonest in certain 
    directions, yet acquire wealth; but the conclusion usually formed that the 
    one man fails because of his particular honesty, and that the other prospers 
    because of his particular dishonesty, is the result of a superficial judgment, 
    which assumes that the dishonest man is almost totally corrupt, and the honest 
    man almost entirely virtuous. In the light of a deeper knowledge and wider 
    experience such judgment is found to be erroneous. The dishonest man may have 
    some admirable virtues, which the other does, not possess; and the honest man 
    obnoxious vices which are absent in the other. The honest man reaps the good 
    results of his honest thoughts and acts; he also brings upon himself the 
    sufferings, which his vices produce. The dishonest man likewise garners his 
    own suffering and happiness.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.21">
    It is pleasing to human vanity to believe that one suffers because of one’s 
    virtue; but not until a man has extirpated every sickly, bitter, and impure 
    thought from his mind, and washed every sinful stain from his soul, can he be 
    in a position to know and declare that his sufferings are the result of his 
    good, and not of his bad qualities; and on the way to, yet long before he has 
    reached, that supreme perfection, he will have found, working in his mind and 
    life, the Great Law which is absolutely just, and which cannot, therefore, give 
    good for evil, evil for good. Possessed of such knowledge, he will then know, 
    looking back upon his past ignorance and blindness, that his life is, and always 
    was, justly ordered, and that all his past experiences, good and bad, were the 
    equitable outworking of his evolving, yet unevolved self.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.22">
    Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and 
    actions can never produce good results. This is but saying that nothing can 
    come from corn but corn, nothing from nettles but nettles. Men understand 
    this law in the natural world, and work with it; but few understand it in the 
    mental and moral world (though its operation there is just as simple and 
    undeviating), and they, therefore, do not co-operate with it.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.23">
    Suffering is always the effect of wrong thought in some direction. It is an 
    indication that the individual is out of harmony with himself, with the Law 
    of his being. The sole and supreme use of suffering is to purify, to burn out 
    all that is useless and impure. Suffering ceases for him who is pure. There 
    could be no object in burning gold after the dross had been removed, and a 
    perfectly pure and enlightened being could not suffer.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.24">
    The circumstances, which a man encounters with suffering, are the result of 
    his own mental inharmony. The circumstances, which a man encounters with 
    blessedness, are the result of his own mental harmony. Blessedness, not material 
    possessions, is the measure of right thought; wretchedness, not lack of material 
    possessions, is the measure of wrong thought. A man may be cursed and rich; he 
    may be blessed and poor. Blessedness and riches are only joined together when 
    the riches are rightly and wisely used; and the poor man only descends into 
    wretchedness when he regards his lot as a burden unjustly imposed.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.25">
    Indigence and indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness. They are both 
    equally unnatural and the result of mental disorder. A man is not rightly 
    conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and prosperous being; and happiness, 
    health, and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner 
    with the outer, of the man with his surroundings.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.26">
    A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile, and commences 
    to search for the hidden justice which regulates his life. And as he adapts his 
    mind to that regulating factor, he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his 
    condition, and builds himself up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick 
    against circumstances, but begins to use them as aids to his more rapid progress, 
    and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.27">
    Law, not confusion, is the dominating principle in the universe; justice, not 
    injustice, is the soul and substance of life; and righteousness, not 
    corruption, is the moulding and moving force in the spiritual government of 
    the world. This being so, man has but to right himself to find that the 
    universe is right; and during the process of putting himself right he will 
    find that as he alters his thoughts towards things and other people, things 
    and other people will alter towards him.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ch.2:p.28">
    The proof of this truth is in every person, and it therefore admits of easy 
    investigation by systematic introspection and self-analysis. Let a man radically 
    alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at the rapid transformation it 
    will effect in the material conditions of his life. Men imagine that thought 
    can be kept secret, but it cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit 
    solidifies into circumstance. Bestial thoughts crystallize into habits of drunkenness 
    and sensuality, which solidify into circumstances of destitution and disease: 
    impure thoughts of every kind crystallize into enervating and confusing habits, 
    which solidify into distracting and adverse circumstances: thoughts of fear, 
    doubt, and indecision crystallize into weak, unmanly, and irresolute habits, 
    which solidify into circumstances of failure, indigence, and slavish dependence: 
    lazy thoughts crystallize into habits of uncleanliness and dishonesty, which 
    solidify into circumstances of foulness and beggary: hateful and condemnatory 
    thoughts crystallize into habits of accusation and violence, which solidify 
    into circumstances of injury and persecution: selfish thoughts of all kinds 
    crystallize into habits of self-seeking, which solidify into circumstances more 
    or less distressing. On the other hand, beautiful thoughts of all kinds crystallize 
    into habits of grace and kindliness, which solidify into genial and sunny 
    circumstances: pure thoughts crystallize into habits of temperance and self-control, 
    which solidify into circumstances of repose and peace: thoughts of courage, self-reliance, 
    and decision crystallize into manly habits, which solidify into circumstances 
    of success, plenty, and freedom: energetic thoughts crystallize into habits of 
    cleanliness and industry, which solidify into circumstances of pleasantness: 
    gentle and forgiving thoughts crystallize into habits of gentleness, which solidify 
    into protective and preservative circumstances: loving and unselfish thoughts 
    crystallize into habits of self-forgetfulness for others, which solidify into 
    circumstances of sure and abiding prosperity and true riches.

      (though by a different route), to failure, unhappiness, and loss, for

      A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to 
      accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his 
      thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or it may be a worldly 
      object, according to his nature at the time being; but whichever it is, he 
      should steadily focus his thought-forces upon the object, which he has set 
      before him. He should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote 
      himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into 
      ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings. This is the royal road to 
      self-control and true concentration of thought. Even if he fails again and 
      again to accomplish his purpose (as he necessarily must until weakness is 
      overcome), the strength of character gained will be the measure of his true 
      success, and this will form a new starting-point for future power and triumph.

      Those who are not prepared for the apprehension of a great purpose should 
      fix the thoughts upon the faultless performance of their duty, no matter 
      how insignificant their task may appear. Only in this way can the thoughts

        <h3 id="ch.5">5. The Thought-Factor in Achievement</h3>
    <p>
      ALL that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts. In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. A man’s weakness and strength, purity and impurity, are his own, and not another man’s; they are brought about by himself, and not by another; and they can only be altered by himself, never by another. His condition is also his own, and not another man’s. His suffering and his happiness are evolved from within. As he thinks, so he is; as he continues to think, so he remains.

      A strong man cannot help a weaker unless that weaker is willing to be helped, and even then the weak man must become strong of himself; he must, by his own efforts, develop the strength which he admires in another. None but himself can alter his condition.

      It has been usual for men to think and to say, "Many men are slaves because one is an oppressor; let us hate the oppressor." Now, however, there is amongst an increasing few a tendency to reverse this judgment, and to say, "One man is an oppressor because many are slaves; let us despise the slaves."

      The truth is that oppressor and slave are co-operators in ignorance, and, while seeming to afflict each other, are in reality afflicting themselves. A perfect Knowledge perceives the action of law in the weakness of the oppressed and the misapplied power of the oppressor; a perfect Love, seeing the suffering, which both states entail, condemns neither; a perfect Compassion embraces both oppressor and oppressed.

      He who has conquered weakness, and has put away all selfish thoughts, belongs neither to oppressor nor oppressed. He is free.

      A man can only rise, conquer, and achieve by lifting up his thoughts. He can only remain weak, and abject, and miserable by refusing to lift up his thoughts.

      Before a man can achieve anything, even in worldly things, he must lift his thoughts above slavish animal indulgence. He may not, in order to succeed, give up all animality and selfishness, by any means; but a portion of it must, at least, be sacrificed. A man whose first thought is bestial indulgence could neither think clearly nor plan methodically; he could not find and develop his latent resources, and would fail in any undertaking. Not having commenced to manfully control his thoughts, he is not in a position to control affairs and to adopt serious responsibilities. He is not fit to act independently and stand alone. But he is limited only by the thoughts, which he chooses.

      There can be no progress, no achievement without sacrifice, and a man’s worldly success will be in the measure that he sacrifices his confused animal thoughts, and fixes his mind on the development of his plans, and the strengthening of his resolution and self-reliance. And the higher he lifts his thoughts, the more manly, upright, and righteous he becomes, the greater will be his success, the more blessed and enduring will be his achievements.

      The universe does not favour the greedy, the dishonest, the vicious, although on the mere surface it may sometimes appear to do so; it helps the honest, the magnanimous, the virtuous. All the great Teachers of the ages have declared this in varying forms, and to prove and know it a man has but to persist in making himself more and more virtuous by lifting up his thoughts.

      Intellectual achievements are the result of thought consecrated to the search for knowledge, or for the beautiful and true in life and nature. Such achievements may be sometimes connected with vanity and ambition, but they are not the outcome of those characteristics; they are the natural outgrowth of long and arduous effort, and of pure and unselfish thoughts.

      Spiritual achievements are the consummation of holy aspirations. He who lives constantly in the conception of noble and lofty thoughts, who dwells upon all that is pure and unselfish, will, as surely as the sun reaches its zenith and the moon its full, become wise and noble in character, and rise into a position of influence and blessedness.

      Achievement, of whatever kind, is the crown of effort, the diadem of thought. By the aid of self-control, resolution, purity, righteousness, and well-directed thought a man ascends; by the aid of animality, indolence, impurity, corruption, and confusion of thought a man descends.

      A man may rise to high success in the world, and even to lofty altitudes in the spiritual realm, and again descend into weakness and wretchedness by allowing arrogant, selfish, and corrupt thoughts to take possession of him.

      Victories attained by right thought can only be maintained by watchfulness. Many give way when success is assured, and rapidly fall back into failure.

      All achievements, whether in the business, intellectual, or spiritual world, are the result of definitely directed thought, are governed by the same law and are of the same method; the only difference lies in the object of attainment.

      He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly.

        <h3 id="ch.6">6. Visions and Ideals</h3>
    <p>
      THE dreamers are the saviours of the world. As the visible world is sustained by the invisible, so men, through all their trials and sins and sordid vocations, are nourished by the beautiful visions of their solitary dreamers. Humanity cannot forget its dreamers; it cannot let their ideals fade and die; it lives in them; it knows them as they realities which it shall one day see and know.

      Composer, sculptor, painter, poet, prophet, sage, these are the makers of the after-world, the architects of heaven. The world is beautiful because they have lived; without them, labouring humanity would perish.

      He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it. Columbus cherished a vision of another world, and he discovered it; Copernicus fostered the vision of a multiplicity of worlds and a wider universe, and he revealed it; Buddha beheld the vision of a spiritual world of stainless beauty and perfect peace, and he entered into it.

      Cherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all, heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built.

      To desire is to obtain; to aspire is to, achieve. Shall man’s basest desires receive the fullest measure of gratification, and his purest aspirations starve for lack of sustenance? Such is not the Law: such a condition of things can never obtain: "ask and receive."

      Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your Vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your Ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.

      The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities.

      Your circumstances may be uncongenial, but they shall not long remain so if you but perceive an Ideal and strive to reach it. You cannot travel within and stand still without. Here is a youth hard pressed by poverty and labour; confined long hours in an unhealthy workshop; unschooled, and lacking all the arts of refinement. But he dreams of better things; he thinks of intelligence, of refinement, of grace and beauty. He conceives of, mentally builds up, an ideal condition of life; the vision of a wider liberty and a larger scope takes possession of him; unrest urges him to action, and he utilizes all his spare time and means, small though they are, to the development of his latent powers and resources. Very soon so altered has his mind become that the workshop can no longer hold him. It has become so out of harmony with his mentality that it falls out of his life as a garment is cast aside, and, with the growth of opportunities, which fit the scope of his expanding powers, he passes out of it forever. Years later we see this youth as a full-grown man. We find him a master of certain forces of the mind, which he wields with worldwide influence and almost unequalled power. In his hands he holds the cords of gigantic responsibilities; he speaks, and lo, lives are changed; men and women hang upon his words and remould their characters, and, sunlike, he becomes the fixed and luminous centre round which innumerable destinies revolve. He has realized the Vision of his youth. He has become one with his Ideal.

      And you, too, youthful reader, will realize the Vision (not the idle wish) of your heart, be it base or beautiful, or a mixture of both, for you will always gravitate toward that which you, secretly, most love. Into your hands will be placed the exact results of your own thoughts; you will receive that which you earn; no more, no less. Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain, or rise with your thoughts, your Vision, your Ideal. You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant aspiration: in the beautiful words of Stanton Kirkham Davis, "You may be keeping accounts, and presently you shall walk out of the door that for so long has seemed to you the barrier of your ideals, and shall find yourself before an audience—the pen still behind your ear, the ink stains on your fingers and then and there shall pour out the torrent of your inspiration. You may be driving sheep, and you shall wander to the city-bucolic and open-mouthed; shall wander under the intrepid guidance of the spirit into the studio of the master, and after a time he shall say, ’I have nothing more to teach you.’ And now you have become the master, who did so recently dream of great things while driving sheep. You shall lay down the saw and the plane to take upon yourself the regeneration of the world."

      The thoughtless, the ignorant, and the indolent, seeing only the apparent effects of things and not the things themselves, talk of luck, of fortune, and chance. Seeing a man grow rich, they say, "How lucky he is!" Observing another become intellectual, they exclaim, "How highly favoured he is!" And noting the saintly character and wide influence of another, they remark, "How chance aids him at every turn!" They do not see the trials and failures and struggles which these men have voluntarily encountered in order to gain their experience; have no knowledge of the sacrifices they have made, of the undaunted efforts they have put forth, of the faith they have exercised, that they might overcome the apparently insurmountable, and realize the Vision of their heart. They do not know the darkness and the heartaches; they only see the light and joy, and call it "luck". They do not see the long and arduous journey, but only behold the pleasant goal, and call it "good fortune," do not understand the process, but only perceive the result, and call it chance.

      In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result. Chance is not. Gifts, powers, material, intellectual, and spiritual possessions are the fruits of effort; they are thoughts completed, objects accomplished, visions realized.

      The Vision that you glorify in your mind, the Ideal that you enthrone in your heart—this you will build your life by, this you will become.

        of others as the result of thought, and as he develops a right understanding, 
        and sees more and more clearly the internal relations of things by the action 
        of cause and effect he ceases to fuss and fume and worry and grieve, and 
        remains poised, steadfast, serene.

        The calm man, having learned how to govern himself, knows how to adapt 
        himself to others; and they, in turn, reverence his spiritual strength, 
        and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him. The more tranquil 
        a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for 
        good. Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase 
        as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity, for people will 
        always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanour is strongly equable.

        The strong, calm man is always loved and revered. He is like a shade-giving 
        tree in a thirsty land, or a sheltering rock in a storm. "Who does not love 
        a tranquil heart, a sweet-tempered, balanced life? It does not matter whether 
        it rains or shines, or what changes come to those possessing these blessings, 
        for they are always sweet, serene, and calm. That exquisite poise of character, 
        which we call serenity is the last lesson of culture, the fruitage of the 
        soul. It is precious as wisdom, more to be desired than gold—yea, than even 
        fine gold. How insignificant mere money seeking looks in comparison with a 
        serene life—a life that dwells in the ocean of Truth, beneath the waves, 
        beyond the reach of tempests, in the Eternal Calm!

        "How many people we know who sour their lives, who ruin all that is sweet 
        and beautiful by explosive tempers, who destroy their poise of character, 
        and make bad blood! It is a question whether the great majority of people 
        do not ruin their lives and mar their happiness by lack of self-control. 
        How few people we meet in life who are well balanced, who have that exquisite 
        poise which is characteristic of the finished character!

        <p id="ch.7:p.7">
        Yes, humanity surges with uncontrolled passion, is tumultuous with ungoverned 
        grief, is blown about by anxiety and doubt only the wise man, only he whose 
        thoughts are controlled and purified, makes the winds and the storms of the 
        soul obey him.
        </p>
        
        <p id="ch.7:p.8">
        Tempest-tossed souls, wherever ye may be, under whatsoever conditions ye 
        may live, know this: In the ocean of life the isles of Blessedness are 
        smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming. Keep your 
        hand firmly upon the helm of thought. In the bark of your soul reclines the 
        commanding Master; He does but sleep: wake Him. Self-control is strength; 
        Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power. Say unto your heart, "Peace, 
        be still!"
